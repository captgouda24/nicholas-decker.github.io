        <p class="paper-abstract">using data on inheritance rules in different regions of germany, i show that there was no discernible selection of immigrants. this sharply challenges narratives of the industrial revolution which credit different family structures a large role in sectoral transformation and growth. this paper is on hiatus, as i believe it has nowhere to go</p>
       <!-- <li><a href="Productivity_and_Plant_Survival.pdf">"productivity and plant survival in the great depression"</a>: version 0.3</li>
        <p class="paper-abstract">large plants were more likely to survive the great depression. plants had falling product per worker as they got larger, but increasing product per labor dollar. this is not adequately explained by differences in market power. i theorize that large production plants were as profitable as small ones, but that their businesses practices led to them having easier access to credit when crisis came. currently under heavy revision, as one of my key results turned out to be a coding error.</p> -->
